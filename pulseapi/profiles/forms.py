        Current hack for making sure that we can choose a creator for a profile
        via the admin. Unfortunately, we cannot circumvent the post_save hook
        that automatically creates a Creator for a new profile, so instead,
        we pass along the selected creator to the post_save so that it knows to
        use the selected creator instead of creating a new Creator.
        For updating profiles, the post_save logic isn't triggered and hence,
        we handle the binding of the profile to the selected Creator here, but
        we have to wait for the profile to be saved first to associate it with
        the Creator.
